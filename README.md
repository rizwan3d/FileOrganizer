# FileOrganizer
Recently, I felt overly annoyed by my messy download folder on my personal computer. There were too many files, and it was in a total mess. I thought to write a simple bot to address this problem.
The Solution
Solution is a Bot that loops the download,desktop or any other folder and determines the file type for each and every file. Subsequently, it creates a folder for that file type. All files with the same file type will be transferred to this folder and or Organise by Date.
We use .Net Core to make it cross platform. but same code work well for .Net Framework ,.Net Standard and on Xamarin so it work on every popular device today.

## Config File
```csv
WatchPath,D:\test\watch
OrgPath,D:\test\org
file extension,folder name
```
